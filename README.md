# utio

Simple tool to display time left on job, done framework-free.

You can see the demo at https://icmx.github.io/utio.

Features includes:

  - Framework-free, modern ES6 and clean CSS code
  - Simple interface for desktop and mobile
  - In-browser notifications
  - Multiple configurations, Local Storage support (configuration is static for now, sorry)
  - Modern Webkit and Gecko-based browsers support

It's not pretending to be a real *project*, but can be used to check some of my skills I suppose.

## Why "utio"?

It's for "**y**our **t**ime **i**s **o**ver". It's a catchphrase, but I can't remember who said that.
