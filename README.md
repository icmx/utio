# utio

**utio** is a simple tool to display time left on job, done framework-free.

You can see the demo at https://icmx.github.io/utio.

Features includes:

  - Framework-free: modern JS (ES6+) and clean CSS without preprocessors
  - Simple interface for desktop and mobile
  - Multiple configurations, Local Storage support (configuration is static for now, sorry)
  - In-browser notifications support
  - Modern Webkit and Gecko-based browsers support

It's not pretending to be a real *project*, but can be used to check some of my skills I suppose.
